I recommend starting any project by using ChatGPT. Make sure you're using GPT 5.

## Idea honing

Start with ChatGTP to hone in on an idea:

```txt wrap
Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here’s the idea:

<IDEA>
```

At the end of the brainstorm (it will come to a natural conclusion):

```txt wrap
Now that we’ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.
```

This will output a pretty solid and straightforward spec that can be handed off to the planning step. I like to save it as `spec.md` in the repo.

<Aside>

You can use this spec for a number of things. You can use it to bolster ideas by asking a thinking model to poke holes in the idea (must go deeper!), to generate a white paper, or to generate a business model. You can pop it into deep research and get a 10k word supporting document in return.

## Planning

Take the spec and pass it to the **Thinking** version of GPT 5:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Non-Test-Driven Development">
        ```txt wrap
        Draft a detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building this project. Then, once you have a solid plan, break it down into small, iterative chunks that build on each other. Look at these chunks and then go another round to break it into small steps. review the results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely, but big enough to move the project forward. Iterate until you feel that the steps are right sized for this project.

        From here you should have the foundation to provide a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step. Prioritize best practices, and incremental progress, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step.

        Make sure and separate each prompt section. Use markdown. Each prompt should be tagged as text using code tags. The goal is to output prompts, but context, etc is important as well.

        <SPEC>
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Test-Driven Development">
        ```txt wrap

Look at these chunks and then go another round to break it into small steps. Review the results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely with strong testing, but big enough to move the project forward. Iterate until you feel that the steps are right sized for this project.

        From here you should have the foundation to provide a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step in a test-driven manner. Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step.

        Make sure and separate each prompt section. Use markdown. Each prompt should be tagged as text using code tags. The goal is to output prompts, but context, etc is important as well.

        <SPEC>
        ```
    </TabItem>

It should output a prompt plan that you can execute later with Codex in VS Code. I like to save this as `prompt_plan.md` in your repo.

I then have it output a `todo.md` that can be checked off.

```txt wrap
Can you make a `todo.md` that I can use as a checklist? Be thorough.
```

You can save it as `todo.md` in the repo.

Codex will be able to check off the `todo.md` while working through the project. This is good for keeping state across sessions.

**Yay. Plan!**

Now you have a robust plan and documentation that will help you execute and build your project.

This entire process will take maybe **15 minutes**. It is pretty quick. Wild tbh.
