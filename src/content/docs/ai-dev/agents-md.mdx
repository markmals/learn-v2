`AGENTS.md` is a simple, open format for guiding coding agents. Think of `AGENTS.md` as a `README.md` for agents: a dedicated, predictable place to provide the context and instructions to help AI coding agents work on your project.

```md title="AGENTS.md"
# Contributor Guide

## Setup commands
- Install dependencies: `bun install`
- Start dev server: `mise run dev`
- Run tests: `mise run test`

## Code style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Double quotes, use semicolons
- Use functional patterns where possible
```

## Why `AGENTS.md`?

`README.md` files are for humans: quick starts, project descriptions, and contribution guidelines.

`AGENTS.md` complements this by containing the extra, sometimes detailed context coding agents need: build steps, tests, and conventions that might clutter a `README.md` or aren’t relevant to human contributors.

It is intentionally kept separate to:

- Give agents a clear, predictable place for instructions.
- Keep READMEs concise and focused on human contributors.
- Provide precise, agent-focused guidance that complements existing README and docs.

Rather than introducing another proprietary file, it uses a name and format that could work for anyone.

## How to Use AGENTS.md

1. **Add AGENTS.md**

    Create an AGENTS.md file at the root of the repository. Most coding agents can even scaffold one for you if you ask nicely.

2. **Cover what matters**

    Add sections that help an agent work effectively with your project. Popular choices:

    - Project overview
    - Build and test commands
    - Code style guidelines
    - Testing instructions
    - Security considerations

3. **Add extra instructions**

    Commit messages or pull request guidelines, security gotchas, large datasets, deployment steps: anything you’d tell a new teammate belongs here too.

4. **Large monorepo? Use nested AGENTS.md files for subprojects**

    Place another AGENTS.md inside each package. Agents automatically read the nearest file in the directory tree, so the closest one takes precedence and every subproject can ship tailored instructions.



## For React Router Projects

This `AGENTS.md` file was [created by Brooks Lybrand](https://github.com/brookslybrand/react-router-cursor-rules), the Developer Relations Manager for React Router, to help agents work with React Router projects and it works excellently. I highly recommend using it in all of your React Router projects.
