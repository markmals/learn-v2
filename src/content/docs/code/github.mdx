## Getting Started

-   **Create an account:** On [github.com](https://github.com/signup)
-   Install the GitHub CLI, open Terminal and run:
    ```sh
    brew install gh
    ```

## GitHub In Plain Terms

- Repository: your project’s files plus history, hosted on github.com.
- Organization: a shared account for teams and projects.
- Branch: a workspace for changes separate from `main`.
- Pull Request (PR): propose, discuss, and merge changes from a branch.
- Issue: track tasks/bugs/ideas with labels, assignees, and projects.
- Actions: run automated checks (tests, lint, deploy) on pushes/PRs.

## Web-First Workflow (No CLI)

1. Create a repository: on github.com, click your avatar → Your repositories → New.
   - Name, description, Public/Private, Initialize with README and a .gitignore (Node, Deno, or “None”).
   - Click Create repository.
2. Add files:
   - Use Add file → Upload files to drag-drop images, code, or docs.
   - Or Add file → Create new file to start from the browser.
3. Create a branch from the web:
   - Click the branch dropdown (top-left), type a new branch name (e.g., `feature/hero`), Create branch.
4. Propose changes and open a PR:
   - When editing in the browser, choose Create a new branch for this commit, then Propose changes.
   - Click Create pull request, add a clear title/description, and request reviewers.
5. Review and merge:
   - Use Files changed to comment on specific lines, or add suggestions.
   - Choose a merge method (Merge, Squash, or Rebase). Squash keeps history clean for single-feature PRs.
   - Delete the branch after merge (recommended).

## Create a Repository on GitHub (Website)

- Click New repository → choose Owner, name, visibility, and initialize with README.
- Add description and topics to improve discoverability.
- In Settings → General, enable Issues and Discussions if you plan to use them.
- In Settings → Branches, confirm `main` as default.

To connect an existing local repo, copy the HTTPS URL from the green Code button and run locally:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Issues, Labels, Milestones, Projects

- Issues: create from the Issues tab. Use templates for consistency (Settings → General → Features → Set up templates).
- Labels: color-code by area and priority (e.g., `area:ui`, `priority:high`).
- Milestones: group issues toward a release or deadline.
- Projects: kanban-style planning across repos (Projects tab). Use fields like Status, Priority, and view as Board/Table.

## Pull Requests & Reviews (Website)

- Open PRs from Compare & pull request or from your branch page.
- Request specific reviewers and set Required reviewers with branch protection rules.
- Review types: Comment, Approve, or Request changes. Use Suggestions for quick, inline edits.
- Resolve conversations after addressing feedback. CI checks appear under the Checks tab.

## Collaborators, Teams, and Permissions

- Invite collaborators: Repository → Settings → Collaborators and teams.
- Roles: Read, Triage, Write, Maintain, Admin. Use Teams (in organizations) for scalable access control.
- Transfer ownership or Archive under Settings → General → Danger Zone.

## Optional: GitHub CLI

### Authenticating the GitHub CLI

```sh
gh auth login
```

Follow the interactive set up and choose:

1. **Where do you use GitHub?** GitHub.com
2. **What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host?** HTTPS
3. **Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials?** Y
4. **How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI?** Login with a web browser
5. Follow the instructions and you should get authenticated

### Create a New GitHub Repository

From an existing local folder (recommended):

```sh
# inside your project directory that already has `git init` and at least one commit
gh repo create --source=. --public --push
# or: gh repo create --source=. --private --push
```

This command creates the repo on GitHub and pushes your local `main` branch.

Alternatively, create the repo on the website, then connect it:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Clone an Existing Repository

```sh
gh repo clone OWNER/REPO
cd REPO
```

### Branches and Pull Requests

Create a branch and push it:

```sh
git switch -c feature/hero
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: new hero section"
git push -u origin feature/hero
```

Open a Pull Request from the branch:

```sh
gh pr create --fill --base main --head feature/hero
```

Review PRs:

```sh
gh pr status
gh pr view --web
```

Merge a PR (example uses squash and deletes the branch):

```sh
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

Check out a PR locally (to test changes):

```sh
gh pr checkout <number>
```
