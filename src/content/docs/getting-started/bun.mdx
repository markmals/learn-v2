Now it's time to start running some JavaScript. In the web browser this is easy! You just open the browser inspector (`⌘ + ⌥ + I`), select the "Console" tab, write some JavaScript, and hit `return`. There ya go! The result of your code.

But, we're going to use JavaScript for so much more than running code in the browser. In fact, we're going to use it for *everything*. Or, at least, everything possible and feasible. And in order to do that, we need a way to run JavaScript in environments outside of the browser. Like your computer. And a remote server. And maybe a dozen remote servers, depending on how many people are looking at your site. That's where Bun comes in.

## What is Bun?

Bun is a *standalone JavaScript runtime*. Bun is built on top of the same JavaScript engine used inside of Safari, [JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore), but it adds many utilities and abilities on top of JSC which make it possible to use JavaScript in a number of new ways outside of Safari.

Bun includes an "all-in-one toolkit" for building and running JavaScript applications, including a:

- [Drop-in replacement](https://bun.com/docs) for the [Node.js JavaScript server runtime](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Node.js-compatible package manager](https://bun.com/docs/cli/install)
- [Script runner](https://bun.com/docs/cli/run#run-a-package-json-script)
- [Package runner](https://bun.com/docs/cli/bunx)
- [Scripting shell](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/shell)
- [Database client](https://bun.com/docs/api/sqlite)
- [Another database client](https://bun.com/docs/api/sql)
- [A third database client](https://bun.com/docs/api/redis)
- [File storage client](https://bun.com/docs/api/s3)
- [C language compiler](https://bun.com/docs/api/cc)
- And more...

## Why Are We Using Bun?

Primarily, Bun will serve these purposes for us:

- Run the development server (which is written in JavaScript) so we can test changes to our app locally
- Build our application for production
- Install third-party packages from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) for us to use in our app

## Install Bun

We'll use Mise to install Bun globally:

```sh
mise use -g bun@latest  # install latest bun
```

Verify that Bun was installed correctly:

```sh
bun --version
```

## Bun Basics

You can run any JavaScript file by passing it as an argument to Bun:

```js title="my-script.js"
console.log("Hello, World!")
```

```sh
$ bun my-script.js
> "Hello, World!"
```
