title: Component Architecture
---

Very similar to [Figma components](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma), [SwiftUI Views](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/declaring-a-custom-view), or [Jetpack Compose composables](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/architecture), React pioneered the concept of the "component architecture," enabling you to group functionality and view presentation together in a single unit:

```jsx
function Video({ video }) {
    return (
        <div>
            <Thumbnail video={video} />
            <a href={video.url}>
                <h3>{video.title}</h3>
                <p>{video.description}</p>
            </a>
            <LikeButton video={video} />
        </div>
    );
}

function VideoList({ videos, emptyHeading }) {
    const count = videos.length;
    let heading = emptyHeading;

    if (count > 0) {
        const noun = count > 1 ? "Videos" : "Video";
        heading = count + " " + noun;
    }

    return (
        <section>
            <h2>{heading}</h2>
            {videos.map((video) => (
                <Video key={video.id} video={video} />
            ))}
        </section>
    );
}
```

Components in React use a special file type and syntax called JSX (`.jsx` for JavaScript JSX files and `.tsx` for TypeScript JSX files). JSX allows you to write HTML-like structures in the same file as your JavaScript/TypeScript code.

This means, React components can be TypeScript functions which return JSX structures that describe your UI and then the functions re-run whenever the state of the component changes in response to a user action.

Components can take "props" (properties) like VideoList:

```tsx
function VideoList({ videos, emptyHeading }: { videos: VideoEntry[]; emptyHeading: string }) {
    /* ... */
}
```

and those props can be passed to a component in a fashion similar to how attributes are passed to HTML elements:

```tsx
<VideoList videos={someVideos} emptyHeading="No Videos" />
```
