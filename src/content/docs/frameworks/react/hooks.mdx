title: Hooks
---

Hooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in hooks, hooks from npm packages, or combine them to build your own hooks.

## State

State lets a component "remember" information like user input and causes a component to rerender when the state changes. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.

To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:

- `useState` declares a state variable that you can update directly.
- `useReducer` declares a state variable with the update logic inside a [reducer function](https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer).

```jsx
function ImageGallery() {
    const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
    // ...
```

```jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
    // ...
}

function Profile() {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { age: 42 });
    // ...
```

## Resources

Resources are values inside a container, such as a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or context. Components can subscribe to a resource and update when the resource changes.

- `use` reads and subscribes to a resource (Promise or context).

### Promise

```jsx
function MessageComponent({ messagePromise }) {
    const message = use(messagePromise);
    // ...
```

### Context

```jsx
const ThemeContext = createContext("dark");

function App() {
    return (
        <ThemeContext>
            <Button />
        </ThemeContext>
    );
}

function Button() {
    const theme = use(ThemeContext);
    // ...
```
